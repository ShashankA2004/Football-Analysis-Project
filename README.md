# Football-Analysis-Project

## Introduction

The project aims to detect and track football players, referees, and the ball in video footage using YOLO, a leading object detection algorithm in AI. To enhance accuracy, we will fine-tune the model through training. Players will be assigned to their respective teams by analyzing the dominant colors of their jerseys, using K-Means clustering for pixel segmentation. This classification enables us to calculate each teamâ€™s ball possession percentage throughout the game. Furthermore, by applying optical flow techniques, we can assess camera motion between frames, allowing for precise tracking of player movements. This project integrates several important computer vision and machine learning techniques, making it a valuable learning experience for both beginners and advanced practitioners.
